    "### Rules:\n",
    " - You should write the solution in this notebook and upload the completed notebook on Moodle by the deadline.\n",
    " - You are not allowed to work in groups, every student should submit their own notebook. If you submit two highly overlapping notebooks with another student, you will both be penalized.\n",
    " - The bonus questions are optional. They are not needed to get the full grade, but they can help you to get a higher grade.\n",

    "### The setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Your friend Alex wants to hide a secret code in a probability distribution. The probability density function is a piecewise linear distribution with parameters $0<a\\le b$, defined as\n",
    "$$p(x;a,b) = H(a,b) \\begin{cases} \\frac{x}{a} & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x \\leq a, \\\\ \\frac{b-x}{b-a} & \\text{if } a \\leq x \\leq b, \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "where $H(a,b)$ is a normalization constant. Alex has choosen $a$ and $b$ such that they are the first two and the last two digits of his phone secret code, respectively.\n",
    "For example, if their secret code is 1234, then $a=12$ and $b=34$. Alex stores some sample values of the distribution in a file called on their computer, thinking that nobody will be able to understand the distribution without the secret code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You recently enrolled at EPFL and you are taking the course of _Fundamental of Inference and Learning_, and you want to prove that Alex's phone code is not safe. In this problem, your goal is to discover the secret code by studying the distribution."
