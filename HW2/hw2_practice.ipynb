    "# Homework 2: mask detection for the next pandemic\n",
    "You heard rumors from biology department of EPFL about a new version of a corona virus spreading out next year, already called COVID-25. The virus is so dangerous that you are asked to develop a mask detection system to be deployed in all public places. The system should be able to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not. You are given a dataset of images of people with and without masks. Your task is to develop a machine learning model that can detect if a person is wearing a mask or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The evaluation of this homework will be done on an hidden dataset. It is important that your notebook runs without errors, otherwise we will not be able to evaluate some questions, resulting in a grade 0 for that part. Make sure to double check your code before submitting the notebook. We provide a simple `evaluate` function that you can use to make sure that all the necessary functions are implemented correctly; the function will warn you if it detects that a good prediction cannot be made. `evaluate` takes just one argument: the `scikit-learn` model that you have trained. It expects the model to have a `predict` method that works on a numpy array."
