    "\n",
    "The Expected Prediction Risk (EPR) is a fundamental concept that helps us measure how well our predictions match reality, accounting for all possible scenarios weighted by their probability of occurrence. Consider a supervised learning problem with a dataset $(x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^N$ where $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $y_i$ are the labels (being them real numbers or categorical). We assume that the data is generated by a joint distribution, with density function $p(x,y)$. We fit a model $f(x)$ to this dataset. \n",
